# Customer Churn Prediction 🚀📊
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Snehagandu04/customer_churn_prediction/blob/master/customer_churn_prediciton_(1).ipynb)

A notebook-driven project for predicting customer churn using classical machine learning workflows. The repository centers on a single Jupyter notebook that loads data, performs preprocessing and exploratory analysis, trains models, and evaluates performance.

- 🧠 Models: Classical ML (e.g., tree-based and logistic approaches)
- 🚀 Results: Clear metrics and plots for performance
- 🛡️ Quality: Reproducible environment and documented steps
- ♿ Accessibility: Alt text, readable contrast, keyboard-friendly sections

## Project Structure 🗂️
- `customer_churn_prediction (1).ipynb` — main notebook containing data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

<details>
  <summary>Quick View of Workflow ✨</summary>
  
  - 📥 Load `dataset.csv`
  - 🔎 EDA and preprocessing
  - 🧪 Train models
  - 📈 Evaluate metrics and visualize results
  - 💾 (Optional) Save trained artifacts
</details>

## Prerequisites 🧰
- `Python 3.x`
- `Jupyter` (`jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`)
- Typical data science packages (adjust to match notebook imports):
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

> 💡 Tip: Keep versions consistent to avoid environment drift and ensure reproducibility.

## Setup (Windows) ⚙️
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```powershell
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  pip install -U pip
  ```
- Install core libraries (adjust as needed):
  ```powershell
  pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```

## Data 📂
- Expected input file: `dataset.csv`
- Place `dataset.csv` in the repository root or update the path in the notebook cell where the data is loaded.
- If you are using the Telco Customer Churn dataset (commonly ~7043 rows), you can download it from trusted sources (e.g., Kaggle or IBM sample datasets) and save it as `dataset.csv`.

> 🔍 Ensure column names match the notebook’s expectations and check for missing values.

## Usage ▶️
- Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
  ```powershell
  jupyter lab
  # or
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Open `customer_churn_prediction (1).ipynb` and run the cells in order:
  - 📥 Load `dataset.csv`
  - 🔎 Perform EDA and preprocessing
  - 🧪 Train one or more models
  - 📈 Evaluate metrics and review visualizations
  - 💾 (Optional) Save any trained artifacts

<details>
  <summary>Keyboard & Accessibility ♿</summary>
  
  - Use keyboard shortcuts in Jupyter (`Shift+Enter` to run cells)
  - Provide descriptive titles for plots
  - Prefer high-contrast color palettes
</details>

## Results 🏆
- Record and compare metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC.
- Include key plots (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve) generated by the notebook.
- ✨ Consider adding an animated ROC or training progress GIF for presentation purposes (with alt text).

## Reproducibility 🔁
- Consider setting random seeds for model training where applicable.
- For consistent environments, add a `requirements.txt` with pinned versions (can be inferred from the notebook imports) and share it with collaborators.
- 🛡️ Document data preprocessing choices (encodings, scaling) to ensure consistent results.

## Troubleshooting 🧩
- "File not found" for `dataset.csv`: verify the file path used in the notebook.
- Package import errors: ensure all prerequisites are installed in the active environment.
- Kernel issues: restart the Jupyter kernel and re-run cells.
- 💡 If plots are hard to read, switch to colorblind-friendly palettes.

## Design & Style 🌈
- Curated emojis used across sections for clarity and engagement: 🎯 📊 🧠 🚀 🛡️ ♿ ✨ 🧩 🏆 ▶️ 📂
- Colorful badges visually denote environment and tooling; all images include alt text for accessibility.
- Smooth interactions via collapsible sections (`<details>`); these are keyboard and screen-reader friendly.
- Consistent headings, concise bullets, and clear visual hierarchy for readability on different screen sizes.

## Accessibility ♿
- Provide alt text for all images and badges.
- Use high-contrast colors in plots and figures.
- Ensure meaningful link text and avoid “click here”.
- Keep emojis supplementary; don’t rely on them to convey critical information.

## Responsive Reading 📱
- The README layout minimizes horizontal scrolling and uses concise sections.
- Collapsible details reduce clutter on small screens.
- Images and badges render well on typical GitHub and IDE viewers.

## Next Steps 🛠️
- Extract reusable code from the notebook into Python scripts.
- Add `requirements.txt` and unit tests.
- Optionally containerize with Docker and add CI for reproducible runs.
